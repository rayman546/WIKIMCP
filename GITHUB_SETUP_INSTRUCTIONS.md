# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

To upload your local Wikipedia MCP API to GitHub, please follow these steps:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Enter 'WIKIMCP' as the Repository name
3. Add the description: 'A local Python server implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable LLMs to access and process English Wikipedia content'
4. Choose whether to make it Public or Private
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these files locally)
6. Click 'Create repository'

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions. Look for the section 'push an existing repository from the command line'.

Run the commands GitHub provides, which should look like:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/WIKIMCP.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 3. Verify the Upload

1. After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files uploaded to GitHub
3. The README.md will be displayed on the main page

Your Wikipedia MCP API is now safely stored on GitHub and can be shared or cloned to other environments!
